Known Bugs:
- Game Over on stage 2 and 4 can bug Morga / Garoben on the next gameplay (reset the game to fix this).
- Final Boss area is bugged and some times it spawns more bosses than it should.
- Because mercury uses the same memory space as the player 2, she ends up loading the alternative color in the select screen.

OBS: With the v0.9 update, adding the data needed to edit the damage of all the other characters is a nice thing, but I am too lazy to search for it. Changing the way crystals are spent could also be a good feature to have. Besides all that, I don't think there is much to be done.
