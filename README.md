# PSSME - Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon Editor (Arcade)
An editor for the game Pretty Solider Sailor Moon (Arcade).


You can access the editor [here](https://gamehackfan.github.io/pssme/).


Obs: There is a well known bug, since the byte amount for the levels probably will be bigger or smaller, the gameplay demo done by the CPU will end up bugged. Just play the game before the demo is played. If a way to disable the CPU gameplay demo is found at some point, so it will be added to the editor as a patch.
