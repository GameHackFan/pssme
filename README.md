OBS: With the v0.6 update, the best feature to have now is extra colors for the sailors. Changing the way crystals are spent could also be a good feature to have.
I know where the pallete of the sailors are and they have what looks like empty palletes nearby, just need to find a way to force the player 2 to use the nearby palletes instead of the original. There are still what looks like empty palletes that could be used to add one more color to Kyurene and one more color to Garoben or Bakene.

New Data: Apparently Morga and Garoben can bug sometimes, if you reach the 2nd level and game over, when you start a new game and there is a Morga before the end of the second level, she will be waiting for the rose trigger and she will end up bugging, same for Garoben, if you reach the 4th level and game over, if you start a new game and a Garoben appears before the end of the 4th level, she will also bug when she gets knocked down, to fix this bug, just reset the game in case of game over on 2nd or 4th level.
