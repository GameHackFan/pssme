# PSSME - Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon Editor (Arcade)
An editor for the game Pretty Solider Sailor Moon (Arcade).
<br/><br/>

You can access the editor [here](https://gamehackfan.github.io/pssme/).
<br/><br/>

Version 0.4 Changes:
  - Custom random mode enemy group bug fix.
  - Fixed a bug with the position X range out of the limits of the game causing enemies placed on the left to spawn on the right.
  - Improvements on the level editor.
  - Minor changes and fixes.
<br/><br/>

Version 0.3 Changes:

  - Added random profiles allowing the randomizer to generate easier and harder roms (Easy, Normal, Hard, Savage, RIP - Rest in Pain).
  - Improved the way some bosses are forbidden in some parts of the game.
  - Fixed a bug that was causing the randomizer to get wrong values.
  - Minor bug fixes.
  - Minor changes.
<br/><br/>

Version 0.2 Changes:

- Added a patch to remove the CPU gameplay demo and applied it when applying the randomizer or the level editor customizations.
<br/><br/>

OBS: With the v0.4 update, the randomizer looks very solid now. Having extra colors for the sailors would be very interesting. Changing the way crystals are spent could also be a good feature to have. I have no idea how to do those things now, so maybe this editor will have more updates in the future.
