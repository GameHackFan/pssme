# PSSME - Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon Editor (Arcade)
An editor for the game Pretty Solider Sailor Moon (Arcade).


You can access the editor [here](https://gamehackfan.github.io/pssme/).


Obs: There is a well known bug when you create a rom with the level editor or the seed randomizer, this bug happens because the byte amount for the levels probably will be bigger or smaller, crashing the gameplay demo done by the CPU. Just play the game before the demo is played. If a way to disable the CPU gameplay demo is found at some point, then it will be added to the editor as a patch. A workaround solution for the CPU gameplay demo was found, I can disable the CPU gameplay demo so the game doesn't crash anymore, the fix will come soon.
