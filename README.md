Version 0.3 Changes:

  - Added random profiles allowing the randomizer to generate easier and harder roms (Easy, Normal, Hard, Savage, RIP - Rest in Pain).
  - Improved the way some bosses are forbidden in some parts of the game.
  - Fixed a bug that was causing the randomizer to get wrong values.
  - Minor bug fixes.
  - Minor changes.



OBS: The randomizer might not be perfect, but it is pretty solid already. Maybe more changes will happen in the future.
